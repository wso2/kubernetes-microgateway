Thank you for installing Chore Connect.

Installation Mode: {{ .Values.wso2.deployment.mode | quote }}

{{- $adapterIngEnabled := and (include "choreo-connect.deploymentMode.isStandalone" .) .Values.wso2.ingress.adapter.enabled }}
{{- $gatewayIngEnabled := .Values.wso2.ingress.gateway.enabled }}
{{- if or $adapterIngEnabled $gatewayIngEnabled }}
Please follow these configure DNS records.

1.  Obtain the external IP (`EXTERNAL-IP`) of ingress resources, by listing down the Kubernetes Ingresses.

    $ kubectl get ing -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

    The output under the relevant column stands for the following.

    {{- if $adapterIngEnabled }}

    choreo Connect Adapter
    - NAME: Metadata name of the Kubernetes Ingress resource (defaults to "{{ printf "%s-ingress" (include "choreo-connect.adapterFullname" .) | trunc 63 }}")
    - HOSTS: Hostname of the Choreo Connect Adapter ("{{ .Values.wso2.ingress.adapter.hostname }}")
    - ADDRESS: External IP (`EXTERNAL-IP`) exposing the Chore Connect Adapter to outside of the Kubernetes environment
    - PORTS: Externally exposed service ports of the Choreo Connect Adapter
    {{- end }}

    {{- if $gatewayIngEnabled }}

    Choreo Connect Gateway
    - NAME: Metadata name of the Kubernetes Ingress resource (defaults to "{{ printf "%s-ingress" (include "choreo-connect.fullname" .) | trunc 63 }}"")
    - HOSTS: Hostname of the gateway service ("{{ .Values.wso2.ingress.gateway.hostname }}")
    - ADDRESS: External IP (`EXTERNAL-IP`) exposing the gateway to outside of the Kubernetes environment
    - PORTS: Externally exposed gateway ports of the Choreo Connect
    {{- end }}

2.  Add a DNS record mapping the hostnames (in step 1) and the external IP.

    If the defined hostnames (in step 1) are backed by a DNS service, add a DNS record mapping the hostnames and
    the external IP (`EXTERNAL-IP`) in the relevant DNS service.

    If the defined hostnames are not backed by a DNS service, for the purpose of evaluation you may add an entry mapping the
    hostnames and the external IP in the `/etc/hosts` file at the client-side.

    <EXTERNAL-IP> {{ if $adapterIngEnabled }}{{ .Values.wso2.ingress.adapter.hostname }}{{ end }} {{ if $gatewayIngEnabled }}{{ .Values.wso2.ingress.gateway.hostname }}{{ end }}
{{- end }}
