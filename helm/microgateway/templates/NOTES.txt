Thank you for installing WSO2 API Microgateway.

Please follow these steps to assess Microgateway.

1. Obtain the external IP (`EXTERNAL-IP`) of the Ingress resources by listing down the Kubernetes Ingresses.

  kubectl get ing -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

    NAME                       HOSTS                     ADDRESS        PORTS     AGE
    wso2micro-gw-ingress       {{ .Values.wso2.deployment.wso2microgw.ingress.hostname }}       <EXTERNAL-IP>  80, 443   3m

2. Add the above host as an entry in /etc/hosts file as follows:

    <EXTERNAL-IP>	{{ .Values.wso2.deployment.wso2microgw.ingress.hostname }}
